18 November 2008
ver 1.13

global:
- ExecCPUID now set input value of EBX, ECX and EDX to zero.

graphics:
- Fixed a bug on InitVesa. Which enabled DUGL compatibility with FreeBasic.
- Fixed a bug on both Poly and Poly16 in case of a polygone with more than 3 points
  and the first 3 points are not enough to compute if the polygone is 
  clockwise or counter clockwise.
- Fixed a bug on bar, Bar, bar16 and Bar16.
- Faster and smaller BlurSurf16, Line, LineMap, Line16 and LineMap16.
- Added a first alpha version of FreeBasic header dugl.bi.
- Added color transparency functions:     
  LineBlnd16, LineMapBlnd16, lineblnd16, linemapblnd16, CPutPixelBlnd16, 
  cputpixelblnd16, BarBlnd16, barblnd16, rectblnd16 and rectmapblnd16.

9 August 2008
ver 1.12

graphics:
- Added to Poly16 the support of POLY16_TEXT_BLND and POLY16_MASK_TEXT_BLND allowing 
  to draw a texture mapped poly blended with a color with 32 level of blending. 
  Allowing flat lightening, fog, shineness ...
- Fixed a bug with POLY16_MASK_TEXT which was not always masked.
- Added ConvSurf8ToSurf16Pal allowing to direct convert a 8bpp surf to a 16bpp without
  a lookup table.
- Added full support for uncompressed BMP format with : 
  LoadMemBMP, LoadBMP, SaveMemBMP, SaveBMP, SizeSaveBMP,
  LoadMemBMP16, LoadBMP16, SaveMemBMP16, SaveBMP16 and SizeSaveBMP16.

20 march 2008
ver 1.11

graphics:
- VESA 2.0+ implementation fixes for better compatiblity.
- Added to Poly16 the support of POLY16_SOLID_BLND, allowing to draw a solid color poly 
  blended with destination Surf with 32 level of blending.
- Added BuildTbColConv a much faster version of PrBuildTbColConv but less accurate.
- Reverted to a BlurSurf16 that will not blur the green as Fast as the blue and red.
  This will make a better quality blur, losing less colors and brightness.
- Faster BlurSurf16 by more than 5%.

2 march 2008
ver 1.10 

graphics:
- Faster BlurSurf16 by more than 1100% if the source Surf is a VRAM and a possible
  Speed increase when the source Surf is a RAM on slow computers.
- Faster ConvSurf8ToSurf16 by 25% RAM to RAM.

Timer and Synch:
- Resolved a bug on SynchLastTime.

20 february 2008
ver 1.10 alfa1

global
- Cleaned include files
- Better License.txt
- The GUI, and Sound moved to a new open Source addon library DUGL-PLUS.
  This will keep DUGL a small and fast C/Asm library :)

graphics:
- InitVesaMode Init now any available 16bpp graphic mode.
- SetSurf accepts now a 16bpp Surf as a target drawing Surf.
- Added 16bpp graphic functions : 
  * Poly16 : supporting POLY16_SOLID, POLY16_TEXT, POLY16_MASK_TEXT 
    and the new POLY16_RGB
  * PutPixel16, GetPixel16, Clear16, Line16, LineMap16
  * ClearSurf16, line16, linemap16, putpixel16, cputpixel16, getpixel16, 
    cgetpixel16, Bar16, bar16, rect16, rectmap16
  * PutSurf16, PutMaskSurf16
  * OutText16, OutText16XY, OutText16Mode, OutText16YMode, RViewOutText16Mode
    RViewOutText16YMode,  RViewOutText16XY
- Added RViewOutTextXY for 8bpp text outputting
- Romoved the asm instruction EMMS from all the graphic functions.
  This will increase the rendering speed specially on slow computers.
  Instead the user should call the macro FREE_MMX() when going to use floating math.
- Added ScanLine and Mask to the Surf structure.
- Fixed a bug on CreateSurf, and CreateSurfBuff computing errnously the SizeSurf.
- Added the function SetSrcSurf(Surf *S) to set the current source Surf for all the
  drawing function using a surf, like Poly, PutSurf, PutMaskSurf. Giving the possiblity
  then to pass a NULL pointer as source Surf.


8 april 2007
ver 1.01

global:
- Ported asm source to yasm 0.6
- Added two constants DUGL_VERSION and DUGL_DATE_DMY for better DUGL versionning

graphics:
- VESA init bug fixes after trying to run DUGL under Qemu
- Speed increase up to 30% for POLY_TEXT, POLY_DEG, POLY_FLAT_DEG_TEXT, POLY_DEG_TEXT
- Speed increase for SetSurf
- Speed increase for PrFindCol
- Added BitsPixel to the Surf Structure
- CreateSurf acceptes now all the possible value for BitsPixel (8,15,16,24,32)
- Added ConvSurf16ToSurf8 and ConvSurf8ToSurf16 for converting from-to 16bpp and 8bpp
- Added BlurSurf16 to apply a blur filter over a 16bpp Surf
- Added PrBuildTbColConv which build lookup table for 8bpp, 16bpp conversion
- Fixed ModeInfo.VModeFlag to short from char and added constants for testing purpose

mouse:
- Added new structure MouseEvent
- Added a ring-buffer mouse event stack
- added EnableMsEvntsStack, DisableMsEvntsStack and ClearMsEvntsStack to Enable, disable and clear the mouse events stack.
- Added GetMsEvent to get a mouse event if occured

Timer and Synch:
- Increased the size of synch buff to 156 to add a ring-buffer liste time stack.
- Added SynchAverageTime which return the average 32 times calls between each call to Synch.
- Added SynchLastTime which return the time between the two last call to Synch.

GUI:
- some bugfixes on String
- ListString :
  * Full rework of ListString to be faster and more reliable
  * Added two Insert for (char*) or (String*)
  * Added a default parameter POS=0 to Delete and index, which could be LISTSTR_FIRST or LISTSTR_LAST.
